Nonnormal data such as counts or proportions often defy classical statistical procedures. Generalized linear mixed models {(GLMMs)} provide a more flexible approach for analyzing nonnormal data when random effects are present. The explosion of research on {GLMMs} in the last decade has generated considerable uncertainty for practitioners in ecology and evolution. Despite the availability of accurate techniques for estimating {GLMM} parameters in simple cases, complex {GLMMs} are challenging to fit and statistical inference such as hypothesis testing remains difficult. We review the use (and misuse) of {GLMMs} in ecology and evolution, discuss estimation and inference and summarize [`]best-practice' data analysis procedures for scientists facing this challenge.},

	abstract = {There has been rapid development in tools for multivariate analysis based on fully specified statistical models or 'joint models'. One approach attracting a lot of attention is generalized linear latent variable models (GLLVMs). However, software for fitting these models is typically slow and not practical for large datasets. The R package gllvm offers relatively fast methods to fit GLLVMs via maximum likelihood, along with tools for model checking, visualization and inference. The main advantage of the package over other implementations is speed, for example, being two orders of magnitude faster, and capable of handling thousands of response variables. These advances come from using variational approximations to simplify the likelihood expression to be maximized, automatic differentiation software for model-fitting (via the TMB package) and careful choice of initial values for parameters. Examples are used to illustrate the main features and functionality of the package, such as constrained or unconstrained ordination, including functional traits in 'fourth corner' models, and (if the number of environmental coefficients is not large) make inferences about environmental associations.},

	volume={6},
	doi = {10.1111/2041-210X.12236},
	abstract = {Summary
1. Unconstrained ordination is commonly used in ecology to visualize multivariate data, in particular, to visualize
themain trends between different sites in terms of their species composition or relative abundance.
2. Methods of unconstrained ordination currently used, such as non-metric multidimensional scaling, are algorithm-
based techniques developed and implemented without directly accommodating the statistical properties of
the data at hand. Failure to account for these key data properties can lead to misleading results.
3. A model-based approach to unconstrained ordination can address this issue, and in this study, two types of
models for ordination are proposed based on finite mixture models and latent variable models. Each method is
capable of handling different data types and different forms of species response to latent gradients. Further
strengths of the models are demonstrated via example and simulation.
4. Advantages of model-based approaches to ordination include the following: residual analysis tools for checking
assumptions to ensure the fitted model is appropriate for the data; model selection tools to choose the most
appropriate model for ordination; methods for formal statistical inference to draw conclusions from the ordination;
and improved efficiency, that is model-based ordination better recovers true relationships between sites,
when used appropriately.},
